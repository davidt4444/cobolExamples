devise a coding learning exercise for cobol
Here's a structured learning exercise designed to introduce someone to COBOL programming. This exercise will focus on basic concepts like variable declaration, input/output operations, and simple arithmetic operations, which are fundamental to understanding COBOL:

Exercise: Simple Payroll Calculation
Objective: 
Write a COBOL program that calculates the net pay of an employee based on their hours worked and hourly rate. The program should also calculate gross pay, apply a fixed tax rate, and display all calculated values.

Steps:

Setup Your Environment:
Ensure you have a COBOL compiler installed. There are several options available, including OpenCOBOL (now known as GnuCOBOL) for a free, open-source solution.
Program Structure:
Identification Division: 
cobol
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. PAYROLL.
AUTHOR. YOUR NAME.
Environment Division: 
cobol
ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
CONFIGURATION SECTION.
SOURCE-COMPUTER. YOUR-COMPUTER.
OBJECT-COMPUTER. YOUR-COMPUTER.

INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION.
FILE-CONTROL.
    SELECT OPTIONAL PRINT-FILE ASSIGN TO "PAYROLL.TXT".
Data Division: Here, you'll define your variables:
cobol
DATA DIVISION.
FILE SECTION.
FD PRINT-FILE.
01 PRINT-RECORD PIC X(80).

WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
01 EMPLOYEE-DATA.
    05 NAME PIC X(30).
    05 HOURS-WORKED PIC 99V99.
    05 HOURLY-RATE PIC 99V99.
    05 GROSS-PAY PIC 9(5)V99.
    05 TAX-RATE PIC V99 VALUE .20.
    05 TAX-AMOUNT PIC 9(5)V99.
    05 NET-PAY PIC 9(5)V99.
Procedure Division: Where the logic of your program resides:
cobol
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
BEGIN.
    DISPLAY "Enter employee name: ".
    ACCEPT NAME.
    DISPLAY "Enter hours worked: ".
    ACCEPT HOURS-WORKED.
    DISPLAY "Enter hourly rate: ".
    ACCEPT HOURLY-RATE.

    COMPUTE GROSS-PAY = HOURS-WORKED * HOURLY-RATE
    COMPUTE TAX-AMOUNT = GROSS-PAY * TAX-RATE
    COMPUTE NET-PAY = GROSS-PAY - TAX-AMOUNT

    OPEN OUTPUT PRINT-FILE
    MOVE "Employee Payroll Report" TO PRINT-RECORD
    WRITE PRINT-RECORD
    MOVE SPACES TO PRINT-RECORD
    STRING "Name: " NAME DELIMITED BY SIZE INTO PRINT-RECORD
    WRITE PRINT-RECORD
    STRING "Gross Pay: $" GROSS-PAY DELIMITED BY SIZE INTO PRINT-RECORD
    WRITE PRINT-RECORD
    STRING "Tax Amount: $" TAX-AMOUNT DELIMITED BY SIZE INTO PRINT-RECORD
    WRITE PRINT-RECORD
    STRING "Net Pay: $" NET-PAY DELIMITED BY SIZE INTO PRINT-RECORD
    WRITE PRINT-RECORD
    CLOSE PRINT-FILE

    DISPLAY "Payroll calculated and saved to PAYROLL.TXT".
    STOP RUN.
Compile and Run:
Save the code in a file with a .cob extension, e.g., payroll.cob.
Compile it using your COBOL compiler. For GnuCOBOL, you might use something like:
cobc -x payroll.cob
Run the compiled program:
./payroll
Review & Learn:
Go through the code to understand each part:
How variables are declared and used in COBOL.
Basic arithmetic operations.
Input from the console using ACCEPT and output using DISPLAY.
File handling in COBOL (opening a file, writing to it, and closing it).
Extension Exercise:
Modify the program to handle multiple employees or include overtime pay calculation.

This exercise introduces you to COBOL's syntax, structure, and practical use in a business scenario. Remember, COBOL is very verbose, which is part of its nature due to its origins in business data processing.
