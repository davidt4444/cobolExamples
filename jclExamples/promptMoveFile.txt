generate move a file from one location to another in jcl
Here's how you can write a JCL (Job Control Language) script to move a file from one location to another:

jcl
//MOVEFILE JOB (ACCOUNT),'MOVE FILE',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=X,MSGLEVEL=(1,1)
//STEP1    EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSUT1   DD DSN=SOURCE.DATASET.NAME,
//            DISP=SHR
//SYSUT2   DD DSN=TARGET.DATASET.NAME,
//            DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE),
//            SPACE=(TRK,(1,1),RLSE),
//            DCB=(LIKE=SOURCE.DATASET.NAME)
//SYSIN    DD DUMMY
/*

Explanation:
//MOVEFILE JOB: This line starts the job, naming it MOVEFILE, specifying an accounting information, job name, job class, message class, and message level.
//STEP1 EXEC PGM=IEBGENER: This step executes the IEBGENER utility which is used for copying or moving data from one dataset to another.
//SYSPRINT DD: Defines the output messages from the job step to be written to the system output class specified.
//SYSUT1 DD: This defines the source dataset from which data will be copied. DISP=SHR means the dataset can be shared while this job is running.
//SYSUT2 DD: This defines the target dataset where data will be moved to:
DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE) means create a new dataset, catalog it if successful, and delete if the job step fails.
SPACE=(TRK,(1,1),RLSE) allocates one track of primary space, one track of secondary space, and releases unused space after allocation.
DCB=(LIKE=SOURCE.DATASET.NAME) copies the dataset characteristics from the source dataset.
//SYSIN DD DUMMY: Indicates that no control statements are needed for IEBGENER since we're doing a simple copy.

Remember to replace SOURCE.DATASET.NAME and TARGET.DATASET.NAME with your actual dataset names. This script assumes that the target dataset does not exist or needs to be created; if it already exists, you might need to adjust the disposition (DISP) accordingly. Also, ensure you have the necessary permissions to access both datasets.
DCB=(LIKE=SOURCE.DATASET.NAME) threw an error. Give me an alternative
If DCB=(LIKE=SOURCE.DATASET.NAME) is throwing an error, one alternative is to specify the DCB parameters explicitly. Here's how you can modify the JCL to define the DCB parameters manually:

jcl
//MOVEFILE JOB (ACCOUNT),'MOVE FILE',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=X,MSGLEVEL=(1,1)
//STEP1    EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSUT1   DD DSN=SOURCE.DATASET.NAME,
//            DISP=SHR
//SYSUT2   DD DSN=TARGET.DATASET.NAME,
//            DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE),
//            SPACE=(TRK,(1,1),RLSE),
//            DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=3120)
//SYSIN    DD DUMMY
/*

Explanation:
DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=3120):
RECFM=FB specifies Fixed Block records.
LRECL=80 sets the record length to 80 bytes per record. 
BLKSIZE=3120 sets the block size; here, I've chosen 3120 as it's a common multiple for fixed-block records, but you should adjust this based on your specific requirements or the characteristics of your source dataset.

Make sure to replace these DCB parameters with those that match your source dataset's characteristics if they differ. Here are some common DCB parameters you might need:

RECFM (Record Format):
FB - Fixed Block
VB - Variable Block
F - Fixed Unblocked
V - Variable Unblocked
LRECL (Logical Record Length): The length of each record in bytes.
BLKSIZE (Block Size): The number of bytes in one block. Must be a multiple of LRECL for fixed records.

If you don't know the exact DCB parameters of your source dataset, you can use another utility like IEHLIST to find out these details:

jcl
//LISTDSN  JOB (ACCOUNT),'LIST DSN DCB',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=X,MSGLEVEL=(1,1)
//STEP1    EXEC PGM=IEHLIST
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//DD1      DD DSN=SOURCE.DATASET.NAME,DISP=SHR
/*

This JCL will list the attributes of SOURCE.DATASET.NAME, including DCB information, which you can then use to correctly specify your DCB parameters in your move JCL.
